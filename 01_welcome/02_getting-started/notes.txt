Notes on Getting Started

Objective: obtain a conceptual understanding of machine learning.

========== Machine Learning and AI ==========

Conundrums in AI

1. Intelligent agents have limited resources - processing speed, memory size, etc.
2. Computation is local, but problems have global contraints.
3. Logic is deductive, but many problems are not.
4. The world is dynamic, but knowledge is limited.
5. Problem solving, reasoning, and learning are complex. Explanation and justification add to the complexity.

Characteristics of AI Problems

1. Data often arrives incrementally, not all at the beginning.
2. Problems exhibit recurring patterns.
3. Problems have multiple levels of granularity.
4. Many problems are computationally intractable.
5. The world is dynamic, but knowledge of the world is static.
6. The world is open-ended, but knowledge is limited.

AI as a Technique of Uncertainty Management

AI is what to do when you don't know what to do. Reasons for uncertainty:
	1. sensor limits
	2. adversaries
	3. stochastic environments
	4. laziness
	5. ignorance
	
Which of these are AI problems:
	- Answering questions on Jeopardy?
	- Configuring the dimensions for the basement of a new house?
	- Tying shoelaces?
	- Deciding on a route to a new destination?
	- Making sense of a news broadcast?
	- Designing a robot that walks on water?
	- Establishing whether a flower pot can be used as a drinking cup?
	- Deciding whether or not a new animal is a bird?
Answer: each of these could be an AI problem.

Three Fundamental AI Processes: Reasoning, Learning, Memory

The Four Schools of AI
				thinking
				  |
				  |
	optimally	-----	like humans
				  |
				  |
				acting
				
We can think of AI agents that are optimal or think like humans.

1. Agents that think optimally. (machine learning)
2. Agents that think like humans. (semantic web)
3. Agents that act like humans. (improvisational robots)
4. Agents that act optimally. (airplane autopilot)

Knowledge-Based AI: we are interested in agents that think like humans.


========== Machine Learning and Data Science ==========

Data scientists are people who have a blend of math & stats, hacking skills, and substantive expertise.

Basic Data Scientist Skills:
	- Substantive expertise:
		- knows which questions to ask
		- can interpret the data well
		- understands structure of the data
