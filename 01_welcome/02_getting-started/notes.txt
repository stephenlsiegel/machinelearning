Notes on Getting Started: From Artificial Intelligence to Machine Learning

Objective: obtain a conceptual understanding of machine learning.

========== Machine Learning and AI ==========

Conundrums in AI

1. Intelligent agents have limited resources - processing speed, memory size, etc.
2. Computation is local, but problems have global contraints.
3. Logic is deductive, but many problems are not.
4. The world is dynamic, but knowledge is limited.
5. Problem solving, reasoning, and learning are complex. Explanation and justification add to the complexity.

Characteristics of AI Problems

1. Data often arrives incrementally, not all at the beginning.
2. Problems exhibit recurring patterns.
3. Problems have multiple levels of granularity.
4. Many problems are computationally intractable.
5. The world is dynamic, but knowledge of the world is static.
6. The world is open-ended, but knowledge is limited.

AI as a Technique of Uncertainty Management

AI is what to do when you don't know what to do. Reasons for uncertainty:
	1. sensor limits
	2. adversaries
	3. stochastic environments
	4. laziness
	5. ignorance
	
Which of these are AI problems:
	- Answering questions on Jeopardy?
	- Configuring the dimensions for the basement of a new house?
	- Tying shoelaces?
	- Deciding on a route to a new destination?
	- Making sense of a news broadcast?
	- Designing a robot that walks on water?
	- Establishing whether a flower pot can be used as a drinking cup?
	- Deciding whether or not a new animal is a bird?
Answer: each of these could be an AI problem.

Three Fundamental AI Processes: Reasoning, Learning, Memory

The Four Schools of AI
				thinking
				  |
				  |
	optimally  -------	like humans
				  |
				  |
				acting
				
We can think of AI agents that are optimal or think like humans.

1. Agents that think optimally. (machine learning)
2. Agents that think like humans. (semantic web)
3. Agents that act like humans. (improvisational robots)
4. Agents that act optimally. (airplane autopilot)

Knowledge-Based AI: we are interested in agents that think like humans.


========== Machine Learning and Data Science ==========

Data scientists are people who have a blend of math & stats, hacking skills, and substantive expertise.

Basic Data Scientist Skills:
	- Substantive expertise:
		- knows which questions to ask
		- can interpret the data well
		- understands structure of the data

		
========== From AI to Machine Learning ==========

Definition / Philosophy of Machine Learning 

machine learning: broad notion of building computational artifacts that learn over time based on experience.

### supervised learning: mapping inputs to outputs (function approximation)
		induction: going from specifics to generalities (did the sun rise today? yesterday? day before? We assume sun always rises.)
		deduction: going from generalities to specifcs (eg let A imply B. Assume A. What do we know? B.)

		so supervised learning is function induction.

		rule: if it is cloudy, it rains
		cause: it is cloudy
		effect: it rains

			  RULE
			    |
		 ---------------
		|               |	  
		cause ---> effect


		deduction: given the rule and cause, deduce the effect (think about cloudy/rains example)
		induction: give a cause and effect, induce a rule (does it ever rain when it is not cloudy?)
		abduction: give a rule and an effect, abduce a cause (think again about cloud/rain example)

		Generally: we observe effects, abduce causes, and from that induce a rule.

### unsupervised learning: description/summarization

### reinforcement learning: learning from delayed reward (video gives tic-tac-toe example)


========== Machine Learning in Action ==========

Video on Stanley, self-driving car that won the DARPA grand challenge

Video on health care. Hope is big data can lead to better care and lower cost (really uninformative video).

========== Quiz ==========

### Supervised Learning

X1, X2, X3, ... , Xn -> Y

in supervised learning, given many vectors Xm, we want to develop function f(Xm) = Ym, which we can then run on future X.

Occam's Razor: everything else being equal, choose the less complex hypothesis.

There is a tradeoff between fit and low complexity.

### Spam Detection

We get an email, want to create function to categorize it as Spam or Ham.

How do we turn an email into data?

Bag of words: counts the frequency of words.
	example: "hello I will say hello" becomes the dictionary {"hello":2, "I":1, "will":1, "say":1}

Example:

Spam messages
	- offer is secret
	- click secret link
	- secret sports link

Ham messages
	- play sports today
	- went play sports
	- secret sports event
	- secret sports event
	- sports is today
	- sports costs money

unique words: offer is secret click link sports play today went event costs money = 12 words

### Classification vs. Regression

classification: the target class Y is discrete.

In problems where Y is continuous (eg Y is an element of [0,1]), it becomes a regression problem.

### Linear Regression

Data is an input vector of length n that map to Y

X11, X12, ... , X1n -> Y1
.
.
.
Xm1, Xm2, ... , Xmn -> Ym

In 1 dimensional space, f(x) = w1 * x + w0

Loss = sum (over j) of (Yj - w1 * xj - w0)^2

solution to linear regression problem minimizes the loss function (minimizes the sum of the squared difference between actual and predicted value.)
