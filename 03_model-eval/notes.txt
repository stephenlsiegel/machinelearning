==================== MODEL EVALUATION AND VALIDATION =====================

========== Intro ==========

Course Outline

1. Review basic statistics that describe data, cover useful libraries to manipulate and process data.
2. Ways to evaluate model performance by choosing the appropriate metric for a given problem.
3. How to split a dataset into training and testing sets so we can evaluate a model.
4. Common issues that can arise when our models do not match the size or complexity of the data, and common ways to optimize them.

At the end of the unit, you'll do a project on building a model to fit some data.


========== Prerequisites ==========

1. Programming experience, especially in Python.
2. Familiarity with statistics. Udacity has descriptive stats course and inferential stats course.
