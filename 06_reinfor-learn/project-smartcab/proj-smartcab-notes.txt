========== Smartcab Project Notes ==========

States: at any instant, the smartcab is at some intersection.
	- traffic light (green/red)
	- car at intersection on each incoming roadway & which direction they are trying to go

A timer counts down at each time step.

Outputs:
	- stay put, one block forward, one block left, one block right (no backward)
	
Rewards:
	- reward for each successful trip (get to desired destination within time bound)
	- smaller reward for each correct move at an intersection
	- small penalty for incorrect move
	- larger penalty for violating traffic rules and/or causing accident
