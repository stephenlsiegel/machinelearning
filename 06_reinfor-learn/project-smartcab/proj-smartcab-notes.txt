========== Smartcab Project Notes ==========

States: at any instant, the smartcab is at some intersection.
	- traffic light (green/red)
	- car at intersection on each incoming roadway & which direction they are trying to go

A timer counts down at each time step.

Outputs:
	- stay put, one block forward, one block left, one block right (no backward)
	
Rewards:
	- reward for each successful trip (get to desired destination within time bound)
	- smaller reward for each correct move at an intersection
	- small penalty for incorrect move
	- larger penalty for violating traffic rules and/or causing accident

Environment:
	- grid city, roads go N/S or E/W
	- other vehicles on roads, no pedestrians
	- traffic light at each intersection says either N/S is open or E/W is open
	- green light: left turn only if no oncoming traffic
	- red light: right turn only if no oncoming traffic turning left (is this possible given enviro?) or traffic from left going straight
	-
