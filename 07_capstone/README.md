An included README file which documents the software used, Python libraries (including version), and extraneous installation information is sufficient.

Deliverables:
- A 9-15 page report in PDF addressing the 5 major project development phases.
- All development code necessary for your solution in clean, commented format.
- Any required supporting files for your code (.csv datasets, input files, etc.)
	- if these are large, you can reference download links in the README
- A README documenting the software and libraries used in your project, including any necessary instructions required to execute your code.
