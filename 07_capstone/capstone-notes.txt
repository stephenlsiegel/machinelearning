Capstone Project Notes

Think about a problem domain you are passionate about. Choose an existing problem within that domain which you could solve by applying ML techniques. There are 5 major phases to this project.

===== 1. Definition =====

# Project Overview #

-Has an overview of the project been provided, such as the problem domain, project origin, and related datasets or input data?
-Has enough background information been given so that an uninformed reader would understand the problem domain and following problem statement?

# Problem Statement #

-Is the problem statement clearly defined? Will the reader understand what you are expecting to solve?
-Have you thoroughly discussed how you will attempt to solve the problem?
-Is an anticipated solution clearly defined? Will the reader understand what results you are looking for?

# Metrics #

-Are the metrics you’ve chosen to measure the performance of your models clearly discussed and defined?
-Have you provided reasonable justification for the metrics chosen based on the problem and solution?


===== 2. Analysis =====

# Data Exploration #

-If a dataset is present for this problem, have you thoroughly discussed certain features about the dataset? Has a data sample been provided to the reader?
-If a dataset is present for this problem, are statistics about the dataset calculated and reported? Have any relevant results from this calculation been discussed?
-If a dataset is not present for this problem, has discussion been made about the input space or input data for your problem?
-Are there any abnormalities or characteristics about the input space or dataset that need to be addressed? (categorical variables, missing values, outliers, etc.)

# Exploratory Visualization #

-Have you visualized a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset or input data?
-Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?
-If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?

# Algorithms and Techniques #

-Are the algorithms you will use, including any default variables/parameters in the project clearly defined?
-Are the techniques to be used thoroughly discussed and justified?
-Is it made clear how the input data or datasets will be handled by the algorithms and techniques chosen?

# Benchmark #

-Has some result or value been provided that acts as a benchmark for measuring performance?
-Is it clear how this result or value was obtained (whether by data or by hypothesis)?


===== 3. Methodology =====

# Data Preprocessing #

-If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?
-Based on the Data Exploration section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?
-If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?

# Implementation #

-Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?
-Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?
-Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?

# Refinement #

-Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?
-Is the process of improvement clearly documented, such as what techniques were used?
-Are intermediate and final solutions clearly reported as the process is improved?


===== 4. Results =====

# Model Evaluation and Validation #

-Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?
-Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?
-Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?
-Can results found from the model be trusted?

# Justification #

-Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?
-Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?
-Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?


===== 5. Conclusion =====

# Free-Form Visualization #

-Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?
-Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?
-If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?

# Reflection #

-Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?
-Were there any interesting aspects of the project?
-Were there any difficult aspects of the project?
-Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?

# Improvement #

-Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?
-Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?
-If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?


===== 6. Quality =====

# Presentation #

-Does the project report you’ve written follow a well-organized structure similar to that of the project template?
-Is each section (particularly Analysis and Methodology) written in a clear, concise and specific fashion? Are there any ambiguous terms or phrases that need clarification?
-Would the intended audience of your project be able to understand your analysis, methods, and results?
-Have you properly proof-read your project report to assure there are minimal grammatical and spelling mistakes?
-Are all the resources used for this project correctly cited and referenced?

# Functionality #

-Is the code that implements your solution easily readable and properly commented?
-Does the code execute without error and produce results similar to those reported?
